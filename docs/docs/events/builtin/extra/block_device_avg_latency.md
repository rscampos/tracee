# block_device_avg_latency

## Intro

**block_device_avg_latency** - An event that displays the average latency 
for file write operations to a block device.

## Description

The `block_device_avg_latency` event is designed to track the performance of 
block device I/O operations, specifically focusing on file write actions. 
It triggers after reaching a predefined threshold, at which point it calculates 
and provides the average latency of these operations.

## Arguments
- **average_time** (`u64`): The average latency time for the kernel to perform 
write operation to a block device. In nanoseconds.

## Hooks

### trace_blk_account_io_start

#### Type

Kprobe (using `kprobe/blk_account_io_start`).

### trace_blk_account_io_done

#### Type

Kprobe (using `kprobe/trace_blk_account_io_done`).

#### Purpose

The first function was hooked in order to capture the initial timestamp of a request 
to the block I/O device, while the second one concludes the performance measurement,
ensuring a precise evaluation of the operation's duration.

## Example Use Case

1. Monitoring Block Device Latency: By tracking the average latency, it's possible 
to pinpoint and enhance the performance of underperforming storage devices.
